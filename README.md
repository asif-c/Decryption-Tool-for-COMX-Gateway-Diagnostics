# Decryption-Tool-for-COMX-Gateway-Diagnostics
I have developed a Windows desktop app to decrypt the extracted diagnostics from the COM'X gateways of Schneider Electric.
To test the tool, just download the zip file on your Windows computer and the encrypted diagnostics (Starting with OneEsp..).
Unzip the file and double-click the DecryptCOMXDiags.exe to run it on your desktop.
